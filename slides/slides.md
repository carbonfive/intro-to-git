## Our evening in two parts:

#### 1. Working in a repository on your computer

--

#### 2. Working with a remote repository in the cloud (GitHub)

### Find a pair

Find another partner to pair up with.

Try to mix and match Git abilities - find someone with different level
of Git experience as you!

Choose someone to be the "host", the other is the "collaborator"

Sit down together.

## What's Git?

---

## üìñ Definition!

#### Version control software

*Software that tracks changes to a set of files and folders.*

---

## üìñ Definition!

#### Repository

*A collection of files and folders, where changes are tracked.*

--

"A folder with special powers"

---

## üìñ Definition!

#### GitHub

*An online cloud-based service that stores repositories.*

--

(Remember that GitHub is not the same as Git!)

## Tonight: We are git poets!

We are literary archivists, amassing a large collection of the world's poems.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 1: Fork the `git-poems` repository to your GitHub account.

1. Visit http://www.github.com/carbonfive/git-poems
2. Click the "Fork" button
3. That repository is now copied to your GitHub account!

![Fork button](http://i.imgur.com/l5GNCpb.png)

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 1: Fork the `git-poems` repository to your GitHub account.

View it in your browser at:

http://www.github.com/your-github-username/git-poems.

---

## üìñ Definition!

#### Fork

The act of copying a repository from one account to another.

Implies a change of ownership.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 2a: create a folder to store your code in

It's a good idea to have a folder on your computer to store your repositories in!

Make a new folder called `"Code"` within your `"Home"` folder or `"Documents"` folder.

#### Help your partner when you're finished.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 2b: Clone your repository from GitHub Desktop

Now, we are about to do an action called "cloning", which is the act of copying a repository from the cloud down to your computer.


#### Help your partner when you're finished.

---

![Clone](http://i.giphy.com/l0K42xwweWNlhUmvS.gif)

---

## Done cloning?

Take a look around: welcome to GitHub Desktop.

---

### Step 3: Fix a typo

Uh oh, there's a typo here in one of these poems. Can you find it?

--

 When you've found it, fix it in your text editor. Save the file.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 3: Change an existing file

Now how do we store the change? By "staging" the change and then committing it to the repository. Open GitHub Desktop and click the checkmark next to the changed file.

Note how the change is highlighted.

Now type a message about the change you made, describing why you made it. Click "Commit to master"

---

![Make a commit](http://i.giphy.com/l0K4oGnTSuCuml1Hq.gif)

---

### üìñ Definition!

#### Commit

Contains a record of the changes to files in a repository.

--

Contains a reference to the commit that preceded it.

--

Other metadata, like a summary, a description, and date.

--

It only stores enough information about the "change" to a file, instead
of the entire file itself!

--

*This is a core concept in Git- don't miss it!*

---

### üìñ Definition!

#### SHA (aka hash)

A cryptographic function that assigns a unique ID to the unique change in the file contents and creates a "hash", or cryptographic ID, to give it.

---

### üìñ More on commits

A repository can be thought of as the sum of its commits.

| | Time | SHA  | Action     | Snapshot |
|-|------|------|------------|----------|
|üîµ| 1    | d2cf | add 'A'    | 'A'      |
|üîµ| 2    | 4f52 | append 'B' | 'AB'     |
|üîµ| 3    | e2ac | append 'C' | 'ABC'    |
|üîµ| 4    | 340e | delete 'B' | 'AC'    |

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 3: Change an existing file

Observe now that you've committed, that your new change has been added to the History view in GitHub Desktop.

Can you find the SHA value of your commit?

Can you browse forward and backwards through the History view, from commit to commit in time?

#### Help your partner when you're finished.

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Step 4: Add a file

1. In your text editor, create a new file, "the-road-not-taken.txt"
1. Copy and paste Robert Frost's famous poem into it.
1. Save it.
1. Commit it with GitHub Desktop.

#### Help your partner when you're finished.

# Part 2: Moving to the ‚õÖÔ∏è (GitHub)

---

### Step 5: Learning about pushes

Hosts: push your local repository to GitHub by clicking the "Sync"
button.

---

### Step 6: Getting everybody on the project

Host: Time to add everybody to the project!

Visit GitHub and click on "Settings", then on "Collaborators"

Enter your collaborator(s)' GitHub usernames.

---

### Step 6 cont'd

Collaborators: Confirm your account by email or by visiting the repository web page.

---

### Step 7: Collaborator cloning

#### Collaborators: clone

Collaborators: Open GitHub desktop, and clone the `git-poems` repository for
yourself.

#### Everybody: take some time to commit new poems.

Push to GitHub with "Sync", and have the other person "Sync" the changes back. Then switch roles.

---

### üìñ Definition!

#### Branch

A stream of commits that may diverge from another branch.

--

Useful for keeping work separate from other people's work.

---

---

### Step 8: create a local branch

Collaborator: create a local branch on your computer with GitHub
Desktop. Click on the "Add a branch" button and name your branch `more-poetry`.

![Create a GitHub Desktop Branch](http://i.imgur.com/4sC74j1.png")

---

### Step 8 cont'd

Fill out the rest of the Emily Dickinson poem.

Commit your changes to the `more-poems` branch.

---

### Comparing branches

<img src="http://i.giphy.com/26BRBoSBcgGbccvJu.gif" class="img-responsive" />

---

## Compare your branches

Now you've got a new commit on a branch. Browse around to see all the
new, different changes!

--

Also notice that if you flip back to the `master` branch view, you won't
see your commit show up there.

---

### Step 9: Publish your branch

Click "Publish" in the upper-right hand corner of the GitHub desktop UI.

This pushes your branch to the GitHub.com cloud repository.

Visit your GitHub cloud repository to view your new branch.


---

### üìñ Definition!

#### Pull Request

Pull Requests are places to faciliate the approval of code changes from
one branch back into another.

Often used for code review.

---

### Step 10: Review changes with Pull Requests

Open a Pull Request from the GitHub UI:

---

![Pull Requests](http://i.giphy.com/l41YoufJiqXz5Nkze.gif)

---

### Review and merge the PR on GitHub

Discuss the changes with your partner. Do you agree they are correct?

Practice making comments on the pull request.

Click the big green "Merge" button when you're done!

#### Everybody sync to your local computer.

---

## Make conflicts

Individually, make changes to `favorite_poems.txt`.

* Everybody: Find your favorite poem and add them to the file on your computer.
* Everybody: commit to your local repository on the `master` branch.
* Collaborator: Push your changes up to `master`.
* Host: Sync your changes

---

## Uh oh!

How do you resolve a conflict?

--

#### Save it! Commit it!

---

### Push your resolved conflicts to GitHub.

Then: everybody sync.

---

## Extra credit: poetry share!

Add poems to our repository. Find interesting ones you'd like to share!
Commit and push them to your GitHub accounts.

--

Go around to other groups and practice merging your repositories with
each other. Who can amass the largest collection?
